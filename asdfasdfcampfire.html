<h1 id='header'>You chose to head towards the campfire.  To your surprise, you find two villagers singing some campfire songs, and a third villager who isn't so amused.  They spot you walking nearby and sprint towards you. They pin you to the ground. You notice a beer bottle to the right of you, and to the left of you, you see a guitar. Do you hit them with the beer bottle, or play some campfire songs?
